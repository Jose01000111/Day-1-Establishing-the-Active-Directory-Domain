## ‚òÅÔ∏è Active Directory Migration for the Chicago Bears' New Headquarters

When the Chicago Bears üêª announced their move to the Arlington Heights Racecourse, it signaled more than a new stadium‚Äîit meant a full infrastructure overhaul. I was brought on as a Systems Administrator to build out their cloud-based IT environment from scratch. My job was to ensure that the Arlington Heights location could support secure, enterprise-grade IT operations from day one.

This five-day Active Directory lab simulates that real-world deployment. Throughout the process, I leaned on both my technical knowledge and tools like ChatGPT to clarify configurations, troubleshoot issues, and solidify my understanding of Microsoft Active Directory in Azure. Here's a breakdown of my journey:

## Day 1: Establishing the ‚òÅÔ∏è Active Directory Domain

To kick off the project, I set up the backbone of the environment: a Domain Controller hosted in Azure. This would become the centralized management point for users, policies, and resource access across the new Arlington site.

I deployed a Windows Server VM, promoted it to a Domain Controller, and installed Active Directory Domain Services (AD DS). This created the secure domain that everything else would build on. (ChatGPT helped me double-check domain naming conventions and DNS settings.)

### üß™ Lab Tasks

#### 1. Install Windows Server & Prepare the Environment
I deployed a Windows Server 2022 virtual machine in Azure (Windows Server 2019 would also work). I created a new resource group called ArlingtonHQ-AD-Lab and selected Central US as the region. Once the VM was deployed, I assigned it a static IP address to ensure stable network connectivity. I then renamed the server to AD-CHIBEAR-60005 and set a secure administrator password during the setup process

#### 2. Promote to Domain Controller
After logging into the server, I opened Server Manager, went to Add Roles and Features, and selected the Active Directory Domain Services (AD DS) role. I completed the wizard and, once the role was installed, I clicked Promote this server to a domain controller. I chose to add a new forest, entered a root domain name, and set the Directory Services Restore Mode (DSRM) password. After finishing the configuration, I restarted the server. It successfully came back up as a domain controller for the new forest.

#### 3. Promote to Domain Controller
   
I opened Server Manager, selected Add Roles and Features, and installed the Active Directory Domain Services (AD DS) and DNS Server roles. After installation, I proceeded to promote the server to a domain controller.

#### 4. Promote the server to a üåê Domain Controller.

I promoted the server to a Domain Controller by selecting Add a new forest and setting the domain name to chicagobears.local. I configured the necessary domain and DNS settings, then restarted the server upon completion.

#### 5. Create Organizational Units (OUs)
I used Active Directory Users and Computers (ADUC) to define the departmental structure within the domain. I created the following organizational units (OUs):

Admin

HR

IT

Operations

Staley the bear

##### These OUs will help manage group policies, delegate administrative control, and organize users by department.

## üíª Technology Stack

##### Windows Server 2022	Domain Controller, DNS Server

##### Active Directory Domain Services (AD DS)	Centralized identity management

##### DNS	Domain resolution for internal network

##### Hyper-V / VirtualBox / VMware	(Optional) Virtual environment for lab setup

##### Windows 10/11 Client	Domain join & login test

##### Remote Server Administration Tools (RSAT)	ADUC and other management tools

## üõ†Ô∏è Summary of Lab Goals
##### ‚úÖ Set up a Windows Server as the first Domain Controller

##### ‚úÖCreate a new Active Directory domain: chicagobears.local

##### ‚úÖConfigure Organizational Units (OUs) for each department

##### ‚úÖCreate a domain user account: Staley the Bear

##### ‚úÖJoin a client machine to the domain

##### ‚úÖValidate setup using built-in tools (dcdiag, domain login)
